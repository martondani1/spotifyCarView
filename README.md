# Spotify car view app
Bring back car view into your spotify client!
Since spotify removed the car view at 2021 november, I'd like to create a spotify car view app client. I plan to make it using vue.js and nest it into cordova, so it can be deployed to any phone.


I've used cordova as a plugin for vue with this npm package:
